Recent breakthroughs in the field of machine learning have enabled incredible progress in other fields, including astronomy, drug discovery, cognitive science, and more recently, physics. The intersection between physics and machine learning is a rapidly expanding field, and we'd like to keep abreast of progress, as well as discuss new ideas.

## Topics we like to cover

- Quantum machine learning 
- Physics applied to classical machine learning
- Intuitive physics and learning physical models
